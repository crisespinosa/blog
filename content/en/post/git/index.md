Version Control

1. What is Version Control?
Version control systems are software that helps track changes made to code over time. When a developer edits the code, the version control system creates a snapshot of the files. This snapshot is then saved so that it can be used later if necessary.

2. What is version control used for?
A Version Control System (VCS), also known as a source code management system, is software for tracking and managing changes to a file system.

3. What is GIT, and how does it work?
Git is a set of console utilities that track and fix changes in files (most often we are talking about the source code of programs, but you can use it for any files you like). Git was originally created by Linus Torvalds when developing the Linux kernel.
