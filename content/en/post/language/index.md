#SageMath 
— a computer algebra system covering many areas of mathematics, including algebra, combinatorics, computational mathematics and matanalysis. The first version of SageMath was released on February 24, 2005 as free software under the GNU GPL license. The initial goal of the project was "to create open source software alternative to Magma, Maple, Mathematica, and MATLAB systems". 
Fundamentals of Algebra and Calculus

Sage can perform calculations related to basic algebra and calculus: for example, finding solutions to equations, differentiation, integration, and Laplace transformations. For more examples, see the documentation "Constructions in Sage".
Solving equations
Exact solution of equations

The solution function solves the equations. To use it, don't forget to specify some variables first. The arguments for the solution are an equation (or a system of equations) together with variables.
